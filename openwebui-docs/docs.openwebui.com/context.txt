Open WebUI uses a proxy server called mcpo to translate requests between its web interface and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This crucial middleware makes MCP tools, which often communicate via standard input/output (stdio), accessible to Open WebUI, which requires a standard OpenAPI-compatible HTTP format.
The communication workflow
This process involves three main components that work together to enable tool usage:
The MCP Server: This is a separate application that runs a specific tool, such as a weather checker, a code execution environment, or a file-reading tool. It adheres to the Model Context Protocol but often uses the stdio transport, which is incompatible with web clients.
The mcpo (MCP-to-OpenAPI) Proxy: This lightweight server, developed by the Open WebUI team, acts as a translator. It wraps a command for a local MCP server and exposes it as a secure, standard OpenAPI HTTP server.
Open WebUI: The web-based chat interface interacts with the proxy server over standard HTTP. It does not communicate directly with the MCP server.
How the process works step-by-step
The user initiates a request. In the Open WebUI chat, a user prompts the AI with a command like, "What is the current date and time?".
The Large Language Model (LLM) decides to use a tool. The AI model, having been given access to a "Time Tool," determines that this tool is necessary to answer the user's request. It decides which function to call and what parameters to pass.
Open WebUI sends the request to the mcpo proxy. The Open WebUI front-end sends an HTTP request to the mcpo proxy's specific endpoint for that tool (e.g., http://localhost:8000/time).
The proxy executes the MCP server. The mcpo proxy receives the HTTP request and translates it into a command for the underlying MCP tool. It runs the tool, communicating with it over the stdio protocol.
The MCP server performs the action. The tool (e.g., the Time Tool) runs and gets the current date and time.
The proxy returns the result. The mcpo proxy receives the result from the MCP tool and wraps it in a standard HTTP response.
Open WebUI receives the tool's response. Open WebUI processes the response from the mcpo proxy and passes the information back to the LLM.
The LLM generates the final response. The LLM uses the information provided by the tool to construct a complete and accurate answer for the user, which is then displayed in the chat interface.
Key benefits of this architecture
Interoperability and standardization: Using the OpenAPI standard allows tools written for other platforms to be easily integrated into Open WebUI via the mcpo proxy, following a "develop once, use everywhere" philosophy.
Enhanced security: The mcpo proxy acts as a security gateway. It prevents the direct, insecure stdio communication from being exposed to the network, enforcing standard web security practices like authentication and rate limiting.
Greater flexibility: This setup allows you to grant powerful capabilities to local, offline LLMs by safely exposing tools that interact with a machine's file system, environment, and other native features.

Besides using MCP tool servers via a proxy, Open WebUI can integrate with external tools that are compatible with the OpenAPI specification. This provides a standardized and flexible way to connect a wide variety of services. Open WebUI also has its own plugin framework for "Pipe Functions" and can connect with any LLM server that offers an OpenAI-compatible API.
OpenAPI tool servers
Any tool server that exposes its capabilities as a standard RESTful API can be integrated with Open WebUI, as long as the API is defined using the OpenAPI standard.
The OpenAPI specification is a widely-used standard for documenting and interacting with REST APIs.
The mcpo proxy mentioned in the previous answer translates MCP servers to be compatible with this standard, but tool servers can be built natively using frameworks like FastAPI.
A user can simply add the tool server's URL in the Open WebUI settings to begin using it.
The Open WebUI team provides a repository of reference OpenAPI tool server implementations for common functions like accessing a filesystem, running a Git server, or querying a SQL database.
Pipe functions (native Python plugins)
For services that do not use an OpenAI-compatible API, Open WebUI offers a native "Pipe Functions" framework.
Purpose: This framework allows users to create plugins for custom logic, even for services like Anthropic, Google Search, or Home Assistant.
How it works: Pipe Functions are Python scripts that can be run directly from within Open WebUI.
Built-in editor: A built-in code editor in the "Tools and Functions" workspace allows developers to seamlessly create and integrate new functions.
OpenAI-compatible servers
In addition to tools, Open WebUI can integrate with any LLM server that implements an OpenAI-compatible API, including locally or remotely hosted models. The server acts as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's official API, allowing Open WebUI to manage conversations with any compliant model.
Practical examples of integrated tools
Through these different integration methods, Open WebUI supports a wide range of external tools, such as:
Web Search: Integrates with various external search engine APIs to provide up-to-date web information.
Web Browsing: Can read and integrate content from websites into a chat.
Image Generation: Enables AI-powered image generation capabilities.
External RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Connects to external RAG pipelines and databases for accessing custom knowledge bases.
SQL Chat: Allows for natural language interaction and query generation for databases.
