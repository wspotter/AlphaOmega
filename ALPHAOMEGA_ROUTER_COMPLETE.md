# ✅ AlphaOmega Unified Router - COMPLETE!

## Status: **WORKING** ✨

The AlphaOmega Router is now successfully integrated with OpenWebUI as a **unified intelligent router** that automatically detects user intent and routes requests to the appropriate backend.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Fixed Pipeline Architecture
- **Removed** `pipes()` method and manifold type
- **Created** unified router with automatic intent detection
- **Fixed** model names to match available Ollama models:
  - Vision: `llama3.2-vision:latest` (was `devstral-vision`)
  - Reasoning: `llama3.1:8b` (was `llama3-8b`)
  - Code: `codellama:13b` (was `phind-codellama`)

### 2. Proper Registration
- Pipeline registered in OpenWebUI database as a standard `pipe` function
- Shows up as single model: **"AlphaOmega"**
- No sub-model selection needed - intent is auto-detected

---

## How It Works

```
User types message → AlphaOmega Router
                          ↓
                    _detect_intent()
                          ↓
            ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
            ↓                             ↓
    Keywords Match?              Default: reasoning
            ↓                             ↓
    ┌───────┴───────┐           llama3.1:8b (Ollama)
    ↓               ↓
Agent-S          MCP Server
screenshot       tasks/inventory
    ↓               ↓
ComfyUI         Code Model
images          codellama:13b
```

---

## Testing Results

### ✅ Working:
- **MCP Routing**: "List my tasks" → correctly routes to MCP server, formats response with emojis
- **Ollama Reasoning**: "What is the capital of France?" → routes to llama3.1:8b
- **Ollama Code**: "Write a Python function" → routes to codellama:13b

### ⏱️ Slow (but working):
- **Agent-S**: "What's on my screen?" → Routes correctly but takes 30+ seconds (screenshot capture + vision analysis)

---

## How to Use

### From OpenWebUI UI:
1. Open http://localhost:8080
2. Select **"AlphaOmega"** from model dropdown
3. Type naturally - intent is auto-detected:

**Examples:**
```
"What's on my screen?"          → Agent-S (computer use)
"List my tasks"                 → MCP (task manager)
"Check inventory"               → MCP (inventory)
"Write a Python function"       → Ollama codellama (code)
"What is quantum physics?"      → Ollama llama3.1 (reasoning)
"Generate an image of a sunset" → ComfyUI (image generation)
```

### From API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "alphaomega_router",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "List my tasks"}],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

## Intent Detection Keywords

### Agent-S (Computer Use):
- screenshot, screen, click, type, press
- open app, close window, launch, mouse, keyboard
- "what's on my screen", "show me my desktop"

### MCP (Business Tools):
- task, todo, inventory, stock, customer, vip
- note, sales, revenue, expense, cost
- appointment, schedule, calendar, meeting
- facebook, instagram, social media

### ComfyUI (Image Generation):
- generate image, create image, draw, render
- painting of, picture of, illustration, artwork
- sdxl, flux, visualize

### Ollama Vision:
- analyze this image, what's in this image
- describe image, examine image

### Ollama Code:
- write code, write a function, write a script
- implement, python code, javascript
- create a class, algorithm, debug, refactor

### Ollama Reasoning (Default):
- Everything else!

## Backend Status

All services running and healthy:

```bash
✅ Ollama (localhost:11434) - 25 models loaded
✅ Agent-S (localhost:8001) - vision, mcp, screen_capture enabled
✅ MCP Server (localhost:8002) - 76 tools available
✅ ComfyUI (localhost:8188) - SDXL/Flux workflows
✅ Chatterbox TTS (localhost:5003) - voice synthesis
✅ OpenWebUI (localhost:8080) - AlphaOmega Router registered
✅ Dashboard (localhost:5000) - orchestration active
```

## Files Modified

1. `/home/stacy/AlphaOmega/pipelines/alphaomega_router.py`
   - Removed `pipes()` method
   - Fixed model names to match available Ollama models
   - Unified router with automatic intent detection

2. `/home/stacy/AlphaOmega/register_alphaomega_router.py`
   - Registration script for OpenWebUI database
   - Inserts pipeline as `pipe` type function

---

## Next Steps

### To Test:
```bash
# Quick test all routing paths
python3 /home/stacy/AlphaOmega/test_router_comprehensive.py

# Quick reasoning test
python3 /home/stacy/AlphaOmega/test_quick.py
```

### To Update Pipeline:
```bash
# 1. Edit the pipeline file
nano /home/stacy/AlphaOmega/pipelines/alphaomega_router.py

# 2. Re-register in database
python3 /home/stacy/AlphaOmega/register_alphaomega_router.py

# 3. Refresh browser (no OpenWebUI restart needed!)
```

### To Customize Model Selection:
Edit Valves in OpenWebUI:
1. Admin Panel → Settings → Functions
2. Click "AlphaOmega"
3. Edit Valves (endpoints, model names, logging)
4. Save

## Performance Notes

- **MCP calls**: ~1-2 seconds (network + tool execution)
- **Ollama reasoning**: 3-5 seconds (depends on model size)
- **Ollama code**: 5-10 seconds (larger context)
- **Agent-S screenshot**: 30+ seconds (screen capture + vision model analysis)
- **ComfyUI generation**: 30-120 seconds (depends on workflow complexity)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline not showing in model dropdown?
```bash
# Re-register
python3 /home/stacy/AlphaOmega/register_alphaomega_router.py
# Refresh browser
```

### Empty responses from Ollama?
```bash
# Check model availability
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags | jq '.models[].name'

# Update Valves with correct model names
```

### Agent-S timeout?
```bash
# Check Agent-S logs
tail -f /home/stacy/AlphaOmega/logs/agent-s.log

# Increase timeout in test script (default is 30s)
```

### MCP tools not working?
```bash
# Verify MCP server
curl http://localhost:8002/openapi.json | jq '.paths | keys'
```

## Architecture Benefits

✅ **Single Model Selection**: Users don't need to know which backend to use  
✅ **Automatic Routing**: Intent detected from natural language  
✅ **Extensible**: Easy to add new keywords or backends  
✅ **Streaming Support**: Real-time responses with status updates  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks with helpful messages  
✅ **Logging**: All routing decisions logged for debugging
