### Keep These

- All scripts in scripts/ folder
- Dashboard and templates

- **review/old_scripts/** - Wrong/old scripts
- **review/old_configs/** - Old configuration files
- **review/old_data/** - Old data directories

## 🔧 OpenWebUI Fix Applied

**Problem**: Protobuf version incompatibility  
**Solution**: Installed protobuf==5.26.1  
**Status**: ✅ OpenWebUI now starts successfully

Note: One package (descript-audiotools) shows a warning but it doesn't affect OpenWebUI functionality.

## 🚀 Next Steps for GitHub

1. **Review old files**: `ls -la review/old_docs/`
2. **Delete review folder**: `rm -rf review/` (when satisfied)
3. **Add LICENSE file**: MIT license recommended
4. **Create first commit**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: AlphaOmega unified AI platform"
   git push -u origin main
   ```
