# AlphaOmega Example Workflows

## Computer Use Automation Examples

### 1. Screen Analysis

**User**: "What's currently on my screen?"

**Flow**:
1. OpenWebUI receives request
2. Pipeline detects "screen" keyword → routes to Agent-S
3. Agent-S captures screenshot
4. Sends to LLaVA 34B on GPU 0
5. Returns analysis:

```
I can see your screen. Here's what I found:

The desktop shows:
- Firefox browser window (center) displaying a code editor
- Terminal window (bottom-left) showing bash prompt
- File manager (top-right) with directory listing
- System tray (top) showing time: 2:34 PM
```

---

## Code Generation Examples

### 6. Python Function

**User**: "Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers"

**Flow**:
1. Detects "write" + "Python function" → routes to CodeLlama
2. CodeLlama generates optimized code:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

---

### 7. FastAPI Endpoint

**User**: "Write a FastAPI endpoint to handle user registration"

**Flow**:
1. Routes to CodeLlama on GPU 1
2. Generates complete, production-ready code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr
from datetime import datetime

app = FastAPI()

class UserRegistration(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    username: str
    password: str

@app.post("/register")
async def register_user(user: UserRegistration):
    # Validate input
    if len(user.password) < 8:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400, 
            detail="Password must be at least 8 characters"
        )
    
    # In production: hash password, check if user exists, save to DB
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "user_id": "generated_id",
        "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

---

## Reasoning Examples

### 8. Technical Explanation

**User**: "Explain how Docker containers differ from virtual machines"

**Flow**:
1. Detects explanation request → routes to Mistral
2. Streams detailed response:

```
Docker containers and virtual machines (VMs) both provide 
isolation, but work differently:

Virtual Machines:
- Run complete OS with kernel
- Heavy resource usage (GBs of RAM per VM)
- Slower startup (minutes)
- Strong isolation via hypervisor
- Use case: Running different OS types

Docker Containers:
- Share host kernel
- Lightweight (MBs of RAM)
- Fast startup (seconds)
- Process-level isolation
- Use case: Microservices, consistent deployment

Key difference: VMs virtualize hardware, containers virtualize 
the OS. Containers are faster and more efficient for running 
multiple instances of the same OS.
```

### 9. Complex Analysis

**User**: "What are the trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL databases?"

**Flow**:
1. Routes to Mistral for reasoning
2. Provides structured analysis with pros/cons

---

## Multi-Step Workflows

### 10. Screenshot + Code Generation

**User**: "Take a screenshot of VS Code and write code to automate what you see"

**Flow**:
1. Agent-S captures screen
2. LLaVA analyzes: "VS Code with Python file open, showing web scraping code"
3. Routes to CodeLlama
4. Generates automation script:

```python
# Automated code based on screenshot analysis
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_webpage(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract data based on observed pattern
    titles = soup.find_all('h2', class_='title')
    return [title.text.strip() for title in titles]
```

---

### 11. Generate + Analyze

**User**: "Generate an image of a network diagram, then explain what you see"

**User**: "What windows are open and which one is focused?"

**Flow**:
1. Captures screen
2. LLaVA analyzes:
   ```
   Open windows:
   1. Firefox (focused) - center
   2. VS Code - left
   3. Terminal - bottom
   
   The Firefox window is currently active (has focus).
   ```

## Performance Examples

### 16. Parallel Processing

**User 1**: "Generate an image of sunset"
**User 2**: "Explain quantum computing"

**Flow**:
- User 1 → ComfyUI GPU 2
- User 2 → Mistral GPU 1
- Both process simultaneously
- Independent responses

---

### 17. GPU Load Balancing

When multiple requests come in:
- Vision requests → GPU 0 (LLaVA queue)
- Code/reasoning → GPU 1 (Mistral/CodeLlama alternates)
- Image generation → GPU 2 (ComfyUI queue)

All three GPUs can work simultaneously!

## Tips for Best Results

### Vision/Computer Use
- Be specific: "Click the blue Submit button in the top-right"
- Give context: "In the Firefox window, find the search bar"
- Wait between actions: System needs time to respond

### Image Generation
- Describe details: "photorealistic", "artistic", "cartoon style"
- Specify composition: "centered", "wide angle", "close-up"
- Include mood: "dark and moody", "bright and cheerful"

### Code Generation
- Specify language: "in Python", "using FastAPI"
- Mention requirements: "with error handling", "async/await"
- Request tests: "include unit tests"

### Reasoning
- Ask follow-ups: Build on previous responses
- Request structure: "explain step-by-step", "pros and cons"
- Specify depth: "brief overview" vs "detailed explanation"
