## Next Actions

### Option 1: Keep Stashed Changes
If you want to apply your local modifications on top of the GitHub changes:
```bash
cd /home/stacy/AlphaOmega
git stash pop
# Resolve any conflicts manually
git add -A
git commit -m "Apply local modifications"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Discard Stashed Changes
If the GitHub versions are what you want:
```bash
cd /home/stacy/AlphaOmega
git stash drop
```

### Option 3: Review Stashed Changes
To see what's in the stash before deciding:
```bash
cd /home/stacy/AlphaOmega
git stash show -p
```

## Submodule Status

The `mcpart` submodule shows modifications. To sync it:

```bash
cd /home/stacy/AlphaOmega/mcpart
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "Update mcpart configuration"
git push

cd /home/stacy/AlphaOmega
git add mcpart
git commit -m "Update mcpart submodule reference"
git push origin main
```

Or to reset it to the tracked commit:
```bash
cd /home/stacy/AlphaOmega
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## OpenWebUI MCP Integration

You now have comprehensive MCP bridge documentation in:
- `openwebui-docs/docs.openwebui.com/mcp-agent/`

This includes:
- MCP bridge pattern examples
- OpenAPI integration guides
- Working code samples
- Mock clients for testing

**Use this to configure OpenWebUI with OpenAPI approach!**
